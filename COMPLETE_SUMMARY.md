## 🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED

### 1. ✅ Critical Authentication Bypass
**Problem:** Anyone could login with any email/password  
**Solution:**
- Now verifies passwords against database
- Uses bcrypt (12 rounds) for password hashing
- Removed hardcoded test credentials
- Added rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 min)
- Password strength validation (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers)

**Files Changed:**
- `app/(auth)/actions.ts` - Complete rewrite with proper auth
- `lib/auth.ts` - Updated to use JWT

---

### 2. ✅ Insecure Session Management
**Problem:** Sessions stored as plain JSON, could be tampered  
**Solution:**
- Implemented **JWT encryption** using jose library
- Sessions signed with HS256 algorithm
- 7-day expiration with automatic renewal
- httpOnly, secure, and sameSite cookies

**Security Upgrade:**
```typescript
// Before: Insecure
const session = JSON.stringify({ email, role });

// After: Encrypted
const token = await new SignJWT({ userId, email, role })
  .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'HS256' })
  .setExpirationTime('7d')
  .sign(JWT_SECRET);
```

---

### 3. ✅ Missing CSRF & Rate Limiting
**Problem:** No protection against attacks  
**Solution:**
- Created **middleware.ts** with security headers
- Rate limiting: 100 req/min per IP
- Added security headers:
  - Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-XSS-Protection
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - Referrer-Policy
  - Permissions-Policy

---

### 4. ✅ XSS Vulnerability in Blog
**Problem:** Blog content rendered without sanitization  
**Solution:**
- Implemented **DOMPurify** sanitization
- Whitelist of allowed HTML tags
- Script injection prevention
- Safe rendering in SSR

**Files Changed:**
- `app/journal/[slug]/page.tsx`

---

### 5. ✅ Image Optimization Disabled
**Problem:** `unoptimized: true` in production config  
**Solution:**
- Enabled Next.js image optimization
- AVIF and WebP format support
- Responsive image sizes
- Converted `<img>` tags to `<Image>` component
- 60-second cache TTL

**Files Changed:**
- `next.config.ts`
- `app/admin/orders/page.tsx`

**Expected Results:**
- 50-70% smaller image sizes
- Faster page loads
- Better mobile performance

---

### 6. ✅ No Caching Strategy
**Problem:** Every request hit database  
**Solution:**
- Implemented **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)**
- Homepage: 30 min revalidation
- Product pages: 1 hour revalidation
- Products list: 15 min revalidation

**Files Changed:**
- `app/page.tsx`
- `app/products/[slug]/page.tsx`

**Expected Results:**
- 40-60% faster page loads
- Reduced database load
- Better TTFB (Time To First Byte)

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Before Deployment

### Required Environment Variables

Add these to your **Coolify dashboard**:

```bash
# Generate with: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
JWT_SECRET="your-secure-random-string-here"

# Already configured
ADMIN_EMAILS="atifjan2019@gmail.com"
```

### Important Notes

1. **Old sessions will be invalid** - Users need to re-login
2. **Existing users without passwords** - Need to re-register
3. **Rate limiting is active** - 5 login attempts per 15 minutes
4. **Password requirements** - 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers

---

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### 1. Set Environment Variables in Coolify
- Add `JWT_SECRET` (generate with crypto)
- Verify `ADMIN_EMAILS`

### 2. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Security & Performance: Major improvements"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Deploy on Coolify
- Automatic deployment triggers
- Or manually deploy from dashboard

### 4. Test
- ✅ Register new user
- ✅ Login with password
- ✅ Test wrong password (should fail)
- ✅ Check admin access
- ✅ Verify images load fast
- ✅ Check page speed
