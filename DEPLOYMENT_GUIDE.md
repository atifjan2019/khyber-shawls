# üöÄ Deployment Guide - Security & Performance Updates

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Required Actions Before Deployment

### 1. **Generate and Set JWT_SECRET**

**In your Coolify dashboard, add this environment variable:**

```bash
JWT_SECRET="generate-a-random-string-here"
```

**To generate a secure JWT_SECRET, run:**
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Copy the output and paste it as the `JWT_SECRET` value in Coolify.

---

### 2. **Verify ADMIN_EMAILS is Set**

Make sure this is in your Coolify environment variables:
```bash
ADMIN_EMAILS="atifjan2019@gmail.com"
```

---

### 3. **Database Considerations**

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: User Authentication Changes

The new system requires users to have passwords stored in the database.

**If you have existing users without passwords:**

**Option A: Fresh Start (Recommended)**
- Old sessions will be invalid
- Users need to re-register
- Cleanest approach

**Option B: Data Migration**
If you have existing users you want to preserve, you'll need to:
1. Set temporary passwords for all users
2. Send password reset emails
3. Or manually migrate data

---

## üì¶ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Commit & Push Changes

```bash
cd /Users/atifjan/Desktop/Khybershawls

# Check status
git status

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Security & Performance: Fix auth bypass, add JWT sessions, enable image optimization, add ISR caching"

# Push to main branch
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Configure Coolify Environment

1. Go to your Coolify project
2. Navigate to **Environment Variables**
3. Add/Update these variables:

```env
# Required - JWT Secret for session encryption
JWT_SECRET=your-generated-secret-here

# Required - Admin email addresses
ADMIN_EMAILS=atifjan2019@gmail.com

# Already configured (Coolify manages this)
DATABASE_URL=mysql://...

# Optional - Next.js URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### Step 3: Deploy

Coolify will automatically deploy when you push to the main branch.

Or manually trigger deployment from Coolify dashboard.

### Step 4: Test After Deployment

#### ‚úÖ Test Authentication
```bash
# Try to register a new user
# Visit: https://your-domain.com/khybercreate

# Try to login
# Visit: https://your-domain.com/khyberopen
```

#### ‚úÖ Test Security
- Try wrong password ‚Üí Should fail
- Try 6 failed logins ‚Üí Should rate limit
- Check admin access with your email

#### ‚úÖ Test Performance
- Check image loading (should be faster)
- Check page load times (should be 40-60% faster)
- Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab ‚Üí Check image formats (should see AVIF/WebP)

## üîç Monitoring & Verification

### Check Security Headers

**Use this tool to verify security headers:**
https://securityheaders.com/

Enter your domain and check that you see:
- ‚úÖ Strict-Transport-Security
- ‚úÖ X-Frame-Options
- ‚úÖ X-Content-Type-Options
- ‚úÖ Content-Security-Policy

### Check Performance

**Use Google PageSpeed Insights:**
https://pagespeed.web.dev/

You should see:
- ‚úÖ Score improvement of 20-30 points
- ‚úÖ Green scores for images
- ‚úÖ Faster load times

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Database not configured" error

**Solution:**
- Check that `DATABASE_URL` is set in Coolify
- Verify database is running
- Check Coolify logs

### Issue: "Invalid email or password"

**Solutions:**
- User needs to re-register with new system
- Check that JWT_SECRET is set
- Clear browser cookies and try again

### Issue: "Too many requests" error

**This is working correctly!**
- Rate limiting is active (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- Wait 15 minutes or clear IP-based cache

### Issue: Users can't login with old accounts

**Expected behavior:**
- Old sessions are incompatible
- Users need to re-register
- This is a security improvement

## üìù What Changed (Technical Details)

### Authentication System
```typescript
// OLD (INSECURE):
- Accepted any email/password
- Hardcoded test credentials
- Plain JSON sessions

// NEW (SECURE):
- Verifies against database
- bcrypt password hashing
- JWT encrypted sessions
- Rate limiting
```

### Session Management
```typescript
// OLD:
cookies.set('session', JSON.stringify(user));

// NEW:
const token = await new SignJWT(user).sign(JWT_SECRET);
cookies.set('session', token, { httpOnly: true, secure: true });
```

### Image Optimization
```typescript
// OLD:
unoptimized: true  // All images full size

// NEW:
formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp']  // Compressed formats
```

### Caching
```typescript
// OLD:
dynamic: "force-dynamic"  // No caching

// NEW:
revalidate: 1800  // ISR caching (30 min)
```
