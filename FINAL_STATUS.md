## ⚠️ Known Non-Critical Issue

### TypeScript Cache Issue (VS Code Only)

**Issue:** VS Code showing red errors for `prisma.newsletter`  
**Impact:** ❌ None - purely editor display issue  
**Runtime Status:** ✅ Works perfectly  
**Production Impact:** ❌ None  

**Why it happens:**
- Prisma Client was regenerated ✅
- Newsletter model exists in types ✅
- TypeScript server hasn't reloaded the new types ⚠️

**Quick Fix (30 seconds):**
1. Press `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows)
2. Type: `TypeScript: Restart TS Server`
3. Press Enter
4. Errors will disappear

**Alternative:** Close and reopen VS Code

**Verification Done:**
```bash
✅ Checked: node_modules/.prisma/client/index.d.ts
✅ Confirmed: Newsletter model exists in generated types
✅ Verified: All CRUD operations available (findUnique, create, update, etc.)
✅ Tested: API endpoints work at runtime
```

See `TYPESCRIPT_CACHE_FIX.md` for detailed instructions.
