## ⚠️ Minor Issues Found

### **1. Newsletter API TypeScript Error** (Non-breaking)
**Issue:** TypeScript showing error for `prisma.newsletter` in `/app/api/newsletter/route.ts`  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Ran `npx prisma generate` successfully  
**Impact:** None - runtime works correctly  
**Note:** VS Code TypeScript server may need reload (Cmd+Shift+P → "Reload Window")

### **2. Stock Indicator Feature** (Incomplete)
**Status:** ⏳ **Last remaining task**  
**What's needed:**  
- Add stock status display on product cards  
- Add stock status on product pages  
- Use `inStock` boolean from database  
- Show: "In Stock", "Out of Stock", or "Low Stock" badge

**Quick Implementation:**
```tsx
// In ProductCard and ProductGalleryTabs:
{product.inStock ? (
  <span className="inline-flex items-center px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-xs font-semibold bg-green-100 text-green-800">
    ✓ In Stock
  </span>
) : (
  <span className="inline-flex items-center px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-xs font-semibold bg-red-100 text-red-800">
    Out of Stock
  </span>
)}
```
