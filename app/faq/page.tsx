          q: "Are all your shawls handcrafted?",
          a: "Yes, every shawl at Khyber Shawls is 100% handcrafted by skilled artisans. Each piece is unique and may have slight natural variations that add to its authenticity and charm."
        },
        {
          q: "What materials are used in your shawls?",
          a: "We use premium quality materials including pure Pashmina, silk, wool, and blended fabrics. Each product listing specifies the exact material composition."
        },
        {
          q: "How can I verify the authenticity of my shawl?",
          a: "All our shawls come with a certificate of authenticity. You can also perform the ring test for Pashmina shawls - a genuine Pashmina shawl should pass through a wedding ring due to its fine weave."
        },
        {
          q: "Do you offer custom or personalized shawls?",
          a: "Yes! We accept custom orders for specific colors, patterns, or sizes. Please contact us at custom@khybershawls.com with your requirements for a quote and timeline."

        {
          q: "What's the difference between Pashmina and regular wool?",
          a: "Pashmina comes from the undercoat of Himalayan mountain goats and is much finer (12-16 microns) than regular wool. It's softer, warmer, lighter, and more luxurious."

          q: "How should I wash my Pashmina shawl?",

        },
        {
          q: "How do I remove wrinkles from my shawl?",
          a: "Use a steamer on low heat or iron on the lowest setting with a cloth between the iron and shawl. Never iron directly. Hanging in a steamy bathroom also works."

        {
          q: "How should I store my shawls?",

        {
          q: "What if my shawl develops pilling?",
